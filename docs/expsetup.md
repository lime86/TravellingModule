Experimental setup
==================

Experimental setups will inevitably differ from site to site depending
on equipment availability. It is recommended for each organisation to
create a page on this Twiki and describe their setup in a free form in
as much detail as practically needed. General considerations are as
follows.

For the chip:

-   Good quality dual / triple channel laboratory power supply capable
    of providing 1.8V @ 1A on each channel.
-   1-2m long custom made cable with a 4-pin Molex connector to power
    the chip.
-   1-2m long display port to display port (mini display port) to
    connect the chip to BDAQ (YARR) readout.
-   Modern PC with &gt; 8 GB RAM, Quad-core CPU, 1TB HD running CentOS 7
    is highly recommended. sudo right is required for FPGA programming.

In addition for the module:

-   High voltage power supply, e.g. Keithley 2410.
-   Single pin Lemo cable with 00 connector.

    Glasgow](CharacterisationSetups#University_of_Glasgow)
