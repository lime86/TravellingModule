Introduction
============

Site commissioning will start with introduction of the "Travelling
Module". The main purpose of the "Travelling Module" exercise is to make
sure that every potential commissioning site is familiar with the basic
operation of the RD53A chip with either YARR or BDAQ setups and the
results from the essential tuning protocols match the results of other
sites. Common chip sent around should help unify setups across the
institutes and help everyone to get up and running while ensuring
consistent results.
