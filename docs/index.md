# Introduction
Site commissioning will start with introduction of the "Travelling Module". The main purpose of the "Travelling Module" exercise is to make sure that every potential commissioning site is familiar with the basic operation of the RD53A chip with either YARR or BDAQ setups and the results from the essential tuning protocols match the results of other sites. Common chip sent around should help unify setups across the institutes and help everyone to get up and running while ensuring consistent results.
