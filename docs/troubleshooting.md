Frequently asked questions
==========================
- Do I have to run a digital scan to send the newly change configuration to the chip?
	- Yes.
- I saw somewhere else says I should use 1.85V (or anything similar) for LDO powering but here it says 1.8V, which one should I use?
	- The LDO can usually operate between 1.4V and 2.0V, so 1.8V or 1.85V does not make any difference.
